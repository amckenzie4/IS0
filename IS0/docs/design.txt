Design.txt
----------

  While most of the design for this tool was thought out ahead of time, 
some pieces were decided by the "huh... I guess I'll do it that way" method.
The prime example there is module naming.  Had I thought about it before-hand,
I would have set things up so that module names always matched the table name
they relate to exactly.  However, since I wasn't thinking about it, module
names have turned out to be plurals, while I generally name tables in the 
singular.  There's no logic or reason behind that -- it's just how I happen
to do things.  There's no reason to stick with this as a standard if you don't
want to, but all modules I make will probably hold to it.
