   Since it is sometimes desireable to redirect a to a page rather than 
including it, the temp_message system allows you to pass a short message to
a new page.  It uses two session variables:  temp_message and 
temp_message_level.  Any level used by the logger can be used in temp_message_
level, plus "dnr".  If the level is set to "dnr", the message will be written
to the screen:  if the level is one recognized by the logger, it will also be
written to the log.
