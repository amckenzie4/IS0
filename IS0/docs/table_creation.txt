Table Creation
--------------


  In general, this system can work with any table in mysql or postgres.  
However, I made a few assumptions, and if you follow these guidelines, your
job of creating a module will be easier.

1) Always include an id column with type serial:  several things (delete,
modify, and so on) rely on the id column as a unique column that will never 
change.
